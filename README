        $pole = $parent->BarberPole(
            -width       => 200,
            -length      => 20,
            -bg          => 'white',
            -orientation => 'vertical',
            -colors      => [qw/red blue/],

            -slant       => 38,
            -stripewidth => 15,
            -separation  => 35,

            -delay       => 50,
            -autostart   => 1,
        );

        $pole->start;
        $pole->stop;

DESCRIPTION
    Tk::BarberPole is a widget in the shape of a rotating barber pole.
    Animation can be started and stopped programatically.

STANDARD OPTIONS
    The following standard widget options are supported:

    -borderwidth
        Defaults to 0.

    -highlightthickness
        Defaults to 0.

    -padx
        Defaults to 0.

    -pady
        Defaults to 0.

    -relief
        Defaults to "flat".

WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
    -autostart
        If set to a true value, animation of the barber pole automatically
        starts at widget creation. The animation can be further controlled
        via the start and stop methods. Defaults to 1.

    -colors
        Specifies the colors of the stripes. The value must be an anonymous
        list of the colors. The number of stripes will always be a multiple
        of the number of colors specified. Defaults to "['red', 'blue']".

    -delay
        The delay, in milliseconds, between successive updates of the stripe
        positions. Each update moves the stripes by one pixel. The smaller
        the delay, the faster the animation. Defaults to 50.

    -length
        Specifies the desired long dimension of the BarberPole in screen
        units (i.e. any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels). For
        vertical BarberPoles this is the height; for horizontal ones it is
        the width. Defaults to 100.

    -orientation
        Specifies the orientation of the BarberPole. Valid values are
        'horizontal', and 'vertical'. Defaults to 'horizontal'.

    -separation
        Specifies the distance, in pixels, between successive stripes.
        Defaults to 20.

    -slant
        Specifies the angle, in degrees, of each stripe. Defaults to 45.

    -stripewidth
        Specifies the width of each stripe in pixels. Defaults to 10.

    -width
        Specifies the desired short dimension of the BarberPole in screen
        units (i.e. any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels). For
        vertical BarberPoles this is the width; for horizontal ones it is
        the height. Defaults to 30.

WIDGET METHODS
    *$pole*->start
        Starts the animation.

    *$pole*->stop
        Stops the animation.

INSTALLATION
    Either the usual:

            perl Makefile.PL
            make
            make install

    or just stick it somewhere in \@INC where perl can find it. It's in pure
    Perl.
